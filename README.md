This is project is done by Zeyad Mohamed Soliman 1200028, Omar Ashraf 1200036 
The code is divided into a classification computer vision model, a module to connect to coppeliaSim simulation and inverse kinematics solver and connect to the arduino board
Also included in the repo, the dataset we created to train our computer vision model and the model we trained on teachermachine platfrom powered by Google cloud
